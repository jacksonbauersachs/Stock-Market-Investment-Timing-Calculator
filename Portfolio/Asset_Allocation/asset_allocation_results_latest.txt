RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Decrease Gold allocation by 4.23%
• Increase Stocks allocation by 3.31%
• Increase Bitcoin allocation by 3.28%
• Decrease Silver allocation by 2.36%

RATIONALE:
----------
• More overvalued assets get reduced allocation
• Less overvalued assets get increased allocation
• Metals are treated as a unified asset class for portfolio rebalancing
• Within metals, aggressive rebalancing between Gold and Silver based on relative overvaluation
• Stocks are treated as neutral and can absorb rebalancing
• Conservative bounds prevent extreme allocation swings
