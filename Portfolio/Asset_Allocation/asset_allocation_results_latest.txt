RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Increase Bitcoin allocation by 2.26%
• Decrease Gold allocation by 3.43%
• Decrease Silver allocation by 1.47%
• Increase Stocks allocation by 2.64%

RATIONALE:
----------
• More overvalued assets get reduced allocation
• Less overvalued assets get increased allocation
• Metals are treated as a unified asset class for portfolio rebalancing
• Within metals, aggressive rebalancing between Gold and Silver based on relative overvaluation
• Stocks are treated as neutral and can absorb rebalancing
• Conservative bounds prevent extreme allocation swings
