Cash                 6.0      6.0        0.0     

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Decrease Bitcoin allocation by 9.1%
• Increase Roth IRA allocation by 8.9%
• Increase High-Yield Savings allocation by 4.5%
• Decrease Gold allocation by 2.9%
• Decrease Silver allocation by 1.4%

RATIONALE:
----------
• More overvalued assets get reduced allocation
• Less overvalued assets get increased allocation
• Cash stays fixed at 6% (never changes)
• Roth IRA & HYS have dynamic stress indicators based on total overvaluation
• All assets move independently based on relative overvaluation
• Drawdown-aware safeguards prevent overshooting into crashing assets
