ALLOCATION COMPARISON:
-------------------------
Asset                Base     Adjusted   Change  
--------------------------------------------------
Bitcoin              30.0     22.7       -7.3    
Gold                 24.0     21.3       -2.7

High-Yield Savings   10.0     13.5       +3.5    

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Decrease Bitcoin allocation by 7.3%
• Increase Roth IRA allocation by 5.3%
• Increase High-Yield Savings allocation by 3.5%
• Decrease Gold allocation by 2.7%
• Increase Silver allocation by 1.2%

RATIONALE:
----------
• More overvalued assets get reduced allocation
• Less overvalued assets get increased allocation
• Metals are treated as a unified asset class for portfolio rebalancing
• Within metals, aggressive rebalancing between Gold and Silver based on relative overvaluation
• Roth IRA is treated as neutral and can absorb rebalancing
• HYS has dynamic stress response based on total market overvaluation
• Conservative bounds prevent extreme allocation swings
