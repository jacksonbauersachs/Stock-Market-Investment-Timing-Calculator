üîç KEY INSIGHTS AND ANALYSIS:
========================================

1. OPTIMAL RESERVE PERCENTAGE SHIFT:
   - 0% interest: 10% reserves optimal (minimize cash drag)
   - 5% interest: 40% reserves optimal (4x increase!)
   - Higher reserves become economically viable when earning competitive returns

2. CASH DRAG EFFECT REDUCTION:
   - 0% interest: High opportunity cost of holding cash
   - 5% interest: Only give up spread between Bitcoin and savings returns
   - Result: Dramatically reduces penalty for holding reserves

3. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS ALL LEVELS:
   - Every reserve percentage improved with 5% interest
   - Improvements range from +4.0% to +12.0% in best cases
   - Average improvements: +4.6% to +5.2%

4. ECONOMIC EXPLANATION:
   - Opportunity Cost = Bitcoin Expected Return - Reserve Return
   - 0% reserves: Full Bitcoin return opportunity cost
   - 5% reserves: Only (Bitcoin return - 5%) opportunity cost
   - Makes higher reserves much more attractive

5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   - High-yield savings accounts (5%+) change optimal strategy
   - Reserve strategies become more attractive in high-interest environments
   - Risk-adjusted returns improve (reserves provide optionality + income)

üìä STRATEGY MECHANICS:
========================================

Best 0% Interest Strategy:
- Reserve 10% of monthly investment ($100/month)
- Buy 50% of reserves when price drops 20% below trend
- Buy 100% of reserves when price drops 40% below trend
- Sell 20% of holdings when price rises 20% above trend
- Sell 40% of holdings when price rises 40% above trend
- Sell 60% of holdings when price rises 60% above trend

Best 5% Interest Strategy:
- Reserve 40% of monthly investment ($400/month)
- Buy 50% of reserves when price drops 20% below trend
- Buy 100% of reserves when price drops 40% below trend
- Sell 25% of holdings when price rises 25% above trend
- Sell 50% of holdings when price rises 50% above trend

üéØ CONCLUSIONS:
========================================

1. Interest rates DRAMATICALLY affect optimal reserve strategy
2. 5% interest makes 40% reserves optimal vs 10% with 0% interest
3. High-yield savings accounts can improve Bitcoin strategy performance by 9.2%
4. Cash drag effect is the primary limiting factor for reserve strategies
5. When reserves earn competitive returns, higher allocations become optimal
6. Real-world interest rates are crucial for investment strategy optimization

üíº PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
========================================

1. Use high-yield savings accounts (5%+) for Bitcoin reserves
2. Consider 40% reserve allocation in high-interest environments
3. Adjust reserve percentage based on available interest rates
4. Monitor interest rate changes and adjust strategy accordingly
5. Multi-tier buy/sell approach outperforms single-threshold strategies
6. Reserve strategies can significantly outperform traditional DCA
