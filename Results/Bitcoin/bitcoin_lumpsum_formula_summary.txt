BITCOIN LUMP SUM SIMULATION - PURE GROWTH MODEL
============================================================
Using 94% R^2 formula: log10(price) = 1.633 * ln(day) + -9.329
Starting from arbitrary day 5439 (absolute price irrelevant)

GROWTH MODEL INSIGHTS:
==============================
Instantaneous annual growth rate at day 1000: 137.33%
Average CAGR over 1 years from day 1000: 222.17%
Average CAGR over 5 years from day 1000: 118.41%
Average CAGR over 10 years from day 1000: 78.25%

KEY INSIGHT:
The growth rate DECREASES over time due to the logarithmic nature.
Bitcoin grows faster in early days, slower in later days.
This is why the formula predicts sustainable long-term growth.
